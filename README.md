# PixelGAN

The repository serves as an exercise to implement Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) to generate images. 

WGAN_GP folder contains the details about the model architecture and the training script. 

pretrained_model consists of the generator and discriminator trained with 25,000 epochs (400,000 updates), learning rate=0.0001

generate_image.py could generate sample images for evaluation using the pretrained model.
